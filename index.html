				<h1 id= "TopOfPage"> The thoughts behind Success </h1> 
				<p class = "center">I believe that Success can be defined by many different aspects and qualities. We usually think about someone who has a bank account reaching into millions and billions when thinking about someone successful, but that isn't always correct. It is not just how much money you have or what car or house you drive or live in. But also the minor details and elements of life that can determine true success. Everyone wants success in their lives but it is not easy to be done than to be said. Anytime we achieve our goals, overcome an obstacle or win we have is what’s called general success. It comes in many different forms but we cannot really identify the success in others because it can arrive in many different ways. So let’s dig a bit deeper into the definition of success and how it is determined and obtained in our lives. </p>

				<h2> Description of a successful person </h2>
				<p> There are various ways you can tell a person is successful. Some can tell from a person's materialistic things or from their inner self. A person who has the ability to achieve personal, professional, and life goals, or even did already, is so-called successful. This is and can be done through some major steps like proper planning, will, and hard work, which may come from experience in his or her life. The quote “Stop chasing the money and start chasing the passion” - Tony Hsieh truly defines the topic of success. Here are some more quotes from the Inc. website on <a href = "https://www.inc.com/jayson-demers/51-quotes-to-inspire-success-in-your-life-and-business.html" target="blank">the successful quotes page.</a> Successful people are confident and can lead themselves in their own paths. They always have their own vision and seek to bring something to life on a daily basis, acting as a mission. An important characteristic a successful man or woman has is they know who they aren’t and don’t waste time on things they are not satisfied with. This allows them to focus only on their vision and work towards that goal every day. When someone is targeting to reach achievement in their life, they don’t focus on the struggle but on his or her destination. Time, days, nights, hours, struggles do not matter for them, because they devote themselves completely to fulfill their goal and attain their destination. Given these points, we can say that a successful person is the most sophisticated person who loves to complete the most difficult challenges. </p>

				<h2> Why is money the most common way of judging success? </h2> 
				<p> We see it everywhere. Nowadays, people measure how successful they are by how much money they have or make. This money reflects on things on what the person does with it such as buying an expensive car or wearing expensive clothes. This is a common misconception that money is every person’s success. There are many theories that prove this idea wrong. For example, if a person robs a bank, now they have money, but does that mean they are successful? Money is not the only thing in life that matters. Success is defined by the achievement of desired visions and planned goals in life. It does not always mean having money is counted towards the thought of success. Yes, money allows you to buy things and show off your wealth, but that isn’t the key point of being successful. We have to understand the thoughts and processes of success which will very much determine success for someone. </p>

				<h2> Teaching the thoughts &amp; processes of success </h2> 
				<p> To be successful you should be thinking the right thoughts.  It doesn’t happen overnight or within a second. It takes great dedication and passion for something you like for you to be able to obtain it. Nothing can or will be done in one day, it will take years' worth of work for you to get closer to success. There is a minimum process that a person has to do to even get closer to success. The real simple way of setting yourself up for success is giving yourself the opportunity to be in the best possible place and scenario which maximizes your potential of being successful. To set yourself into that position of success takes many hours and determination. Things like hard work, dedication, and passion in a thing will lead you to that possible place to success. Many people will say luck is also a factor that can make you successful. But this isn’t always the case, your effort makes you get into a luckier position in life which in return will grant you success. Numerous people want to be successful in life, but it really all relies on someone’s objectives in their daily life. If someone just stays in their bed and does nothing, he or she is not productive. But if someone works hard every day on various things, they are obviously more productive and if they set themselves in a well enough position, they could become very much successful, both on the productive and money side. But does money or success actually keep a person happy? This is a question that is in many people’s minds and there are different answers to it. </p>

				<h2> Does success or money moreover, keep you happy? </h2> 
				<p> People think money and success buy happiness but it really depends on how you think and make use of it. Science tells us that it is better to focus more on being happy rather than on pursuing success for bringing us happiness. For example, money is very major in this world, it allows you to buy certain things which you would like. But this can ruin one’s life as well. Money makes for greed and has influencing factors. You need to know how to handle money in the proper way and not waste it. The key conclusion about if money buys you happiness is it does not. People who earn more than standard people can buy life satisfaction with money, but not happiness. It is shown that many of our problems and challenges will disappear if we focus more on happiness instead of success. But this varies on what a person likes and wants in his or her life. If someone likes and wants to have money (to allow them to get whatever they want) this can be a form of happiness or even success to them. But if someone defines success as a life of peace with no complications, they can be happy with that and continue on. You may work hard your whole life to reach the top only to find out you are not happier than you were when you started. It really depends on you and how you take in the thoughts of success.
