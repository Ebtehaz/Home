				<h2> Exploration of my Music relation  </h2> 
				<p> I love listening to Music. It has so many positive effects on me that I have to listen to it every day. From helping me get a positive attitude to entertaining me, it provides it all. The Health Benefits of listening to music of North Shore University HealthSystem on <a href = "https://www.northshore.org/healthy-you/9-health-benefits-of-music/">the music page</a> has more information of how listening to music is good for your health. </p>
				<h2> Major benefit of Music </h2>
				<p> Listening to music helps me in various ways but one of the best ways is to reduce my stress levels. At some times, I often get stressed maybe due to school works or just basic stuff, but listening to music helps me calm down and think away from the stress. It is a very calming and relaxing thing to do which reduces stress from your stress hormones in your body. It is definetly one of great ways of returning to a cooler mindset and having a great time while doing so. </p>
				<h2> The Genre type </h2>
				<p> The type of Music I mostly listen to is Pop or Hip Hop. I like the pop genre more because there are a lot of variety in the genre to listen to. In my opinion, pop is the best genre in music. It makes you happy and energetic. Many songs are fast-tempo and talk about believing in yourself. When I am having a bad day, I listen to my favourite songs from the pop genre and it uplifts my mood.  </p>
